## The Problem

Git merges by comparing **lines**. When two branches both add code to the same file — even to completely different functions — Git sees overlapping line ranges and declares a conflict:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
export function validateToken(token: string): boolean {
    return token.length > 0 && token.startsWith("sk-");
}
=======
export function formatDate(date: Date): string {
    return date.toISOString().split('T')[0];
}
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```

These are **completely independent changes**. There's no real conflict. But someone has to manually resolve it anyway.

This happens constantly when multiple AI agents work on the same codebase. Agent A adds a function, Agent B adds a different function to the same file, and Git halts everything for a human to intervene.

## How Weave Fixes This

Weave replaces Git's line-based merge with **entity-level merge**. Instead of diffing lines, it:

1. Parses all three versions (base, ours, theirs) into semantic entities — functions, classes, JSON keys, etc. — using [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/)
2. Matches entities across versions by identity (name + type + scope)
3. Merges at the entity level:
   - **Different entities changed** → auto-resolved, no conflict
   - **Same entity changed by both** → attempts intra-entity merge, conflicts only if truly incompatible
   - **One side modifies, other deletes** → flags a meaningful conflict

The same scenario above? Weave merges it cleanly with zero conflicts — both functions end up in the output.

## Weave vs Git Merge

| Scenario | Git (line-based) | Weave (entity-level) |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Two agents add different functions to same file | **CONFLICT** | Auto-resolved |
| Agent A modifies `foo()`, Agent B adds `bar()` | **CONFLICT** (adjacent lines) | Auto-resolved |
| Both agents modify the same function differently | CONFLICT | CONFLICT (with entity-level context) |
| One agent modifies, other deletes same function | CONFLICT (cryptic diff) | CONFLICT: `function 'validateToken' (modified in ours, deleted in theirs)` |
| Both agents add identical function | **CONFLICT** | Auto-resolved (identical content detected) |
| Both agents add different properties to same object | **CONFLICT** | Auto-resolved |
| Different JSON keys modified | **CONFLICT** | Auto-resolved |

The key difference: Git produces false conflicts on **independent changes** because they happen to be in the same file. Weave only conflicts on **actual semantic collisions** when two branches change the same entity incompatibly.

## Weave vs Mergiraf

Tested on 31 real-world merge scenarios across Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go, Java, and C:

| Tool | Clean Merges | Score |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Weave** | **31/31** | 100% |
| Mergiraf (v0.16.3) | 26/31 | 83% |
| Git | 15/31 | 48% |

Mergiraf fails on both-add-at-end-of-file, insert-between-existing, and decorator conflict scenarios. Weave resolves all of these because it operates at entity granularity (functions, classes, methods) rather than AST node level.

## Real-World Benchmarks

Tested on real merge commits from major open-source repositories. For each merge commit, we replay the merge with both Git and Weave, then compare against the human-authored result.

- **Wins**: Merge commits where Git conflicted but Weave resolved cleanly
- **Regressions**: Cases where Weave introduced errors (0 across all repos)
- **Human Match**: How often Weave's output exactly matches what the human wrote
- **Resolution Rate**: Percentage of all merge commits Weave resolved vs total attempted

| Repository | Language | Merge Commits | Wins | Regressions | Human Match | Resolution |
|------------|----------|---------------|------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| [git/git](https://github.com/git/git) | C | 1319 | 39 | 0 | 64% | 13% |
| [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) | Python | 56 | 14 | 0 | 57% | 54% |
| [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython) | C/Python | 256 | 7 | 0 | 29% | 13% |
| [Go](https://github.com/golang/go) | Go | 1247 | 19 | 0 | 58% | 28% |
| [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) | TypeScript | 2000 | 65 | 0 | 6% | 23% |

Zero regressions across all repositories. Every "win" is a place where a developer had to manually resolve a false conflict that Weave handles automatically.

## Conflict Markers

When a real conflict occurs, weave gives you context that Git doesn't:

```
<<<<<<< ours — function `process` (both modified)
export function process(data: any) {
    return JSON.stringify(data);
}
=======
export function process(data: any) {
    return data.toUpperCase();
}
>>>>>>> theirs — function `process` (both modified)
```

You immediately know: what entity conflicted, what type it is, and why it conflicted.

## Supported Languages

TypeScript, TSX, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C, C++, Ruby, C#, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, Elixir, Bash, HCL/Terraform, Fortran, Vue, XML, ERB, JSON, YAML, TOML, CSV, Markdown. Falls back to standard line-level merge for unsupported file types.

## Install

```bash
brew install weave
```

Or build from source (requires Rust):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ataraxy-Labs/weave
cd weave
cargo install --path crates/weave-cli
cargo install --path crates/weave-driver
```

## Setup

In any Git repo:

```bash
weave setup
```

This configures Git to use weave for all supported file types. Then use `git merge` as normal.

To set up for just yourself (without modifying `.gitattributes`), use `.git/info/attributes` instead:

```bash
git config merge.weave.name "Entity-level semantic merge"
git config merge.weave.driver "weave-driver %O %A %B %L %P"
echo "*.ts *.tsx *.js *.py *.go *.rs *.java *.c *.cpp *.rb *.cs merge=weave" >> .git/info/attributes
```

## Jujutsu (jj)

Add to your jj config (`jj config edit --user`):

```toml
[merge-tools.weave]
program = "weave-driver"
merge-args = ["$base", "$left", "$right", "-o", "$output", "-l", "$marker_length", "-p", "$path"]
merge-conflict-exit-codes = [1]
merge-tool-edits-conflict-markers = true
conflict-marker-style = "git"
```

Resolve conflicts with `jj resolve --tool weave`, or set as default:

```bash
jj config set --user ui.merge-editor "weave"
```

## Preview

Dry-run a merge to see what weave would do:

```bash
weave-cli preview feature-branch
```

```
  src/utils.ts — auto-resolved
    unchanged: 2, added-ours: 1, added-theirs: 1
  src/api.ts — 1 conflict(s)
    ✗ function `process`: both modified

✓ Merge would be clean (1 file(s) auto-resolved by weave)
```

## Architecture

```
weave-core       # Library: entity extraction, 3-way merge algorithm, reconstruction
weave-driver     # Git merge driver binary (called by git via %O %A %B %L %P)
weave-cli        # CLI: `weave setup` and `weave preview`
```

Uses [sem-core](https://github.com/Ataraxy-Labs/sem) for entity extraction via tree-sitter grammars.

## How It Works

```
         base
        /    \
     ours    theirs
        \    /
       weave merge
```

1. **Parse** all three versions into semantic entities via tree-sitter
2. **Extract regions** — alternating entity and interstitial (imports, whitespace) segments
3. **Match entities** across versions by ID (file:type:name:parent)
4. **Resolve** each entity: one-side-only changes win, both-changed attempts intra-entity 3-way merge
5. **Reconstruct** file from merged regions, preserving ours-side ordering
6. **Fallback** to line-level merge for files >1MB, binary files, or unsupported types
